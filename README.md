# Red Perfume


## Experimental CSS Atomizer (WIP)

This is a library for a build tool that helps to drastically reduce the total amount of CSS that is shipped for your project. Facebook adopted this atomized CSS approach and it [reduced their homepage CSS by **80%**](https://engineering.fb.com/web/facebook-redesign/). Twitter also atomizes their CSS.

With `red-perfume` you write your CSS however you like (semantic class names, BEM, utility classes, whatever). Then reference them in your HTML normally.

**Example:**

```css
.cow,
.cat {
    font-size: 12px;
    padding: 8px;
}
.dog {
    font-size: 12px;
    background: #F00;
    padding: 8px;
}
```
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Test</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p class="cool cow moo">
      Hi there!
    </p>
    <!--
      <span class="dog">comments are skipped</span>
    -->
    <h1 class="cool cat nice wow">
      Meow
    </h1>
    <h2 class="dog">
      Woof
    </h2>
  </body>
</html>
```
Then `red-perfume` atomizes the styling into atomic classes, and replaces the references to them:
```css
.rp__font-size__--COLON12px {
  font-size: 12px;
}
.rp__padding__--COLON8px {
  padding: 8px;
}
.rp__background__--COLON__--OCTOTHORPF00 {
  background: #F00;
}
```
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Test</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p class="cool moo rp__font-size__--COLON12px rp__padding__--COLON8px">
      Hi there!
    </p>
    <!--
      <span class="dog">comments are skipped</span>
    -->
    <h1 class="cool nice wow rp__font-size__--COLON12px rp__padding__--COLON8px">
      Meow
    </h1>
    <h2 class="rp__font-size__--COLON12px rp__background__--COLON__--OCTOTHORPF00 rp__padding__--COLON8px">
      Woof
    </h2>
  </body>
</html>
```

This output isn't as pretty to read, but it's a build step, *not* your source code, so it doesn't really matter. **Note:** Uglification of classnames is on the TODO list.

This above example already works as a proof of concept with the current code. However, the library needs a lot more work to be usable in most projecta. Look at the **issues** page to see what work is left to be done and how you can help!

## Why is it called "Red Perfume"

This library takes in any CSS and breaks it down to pure Atomic CSS. This is a process called "CSS Atomization", and libraries that do this process are called "CSS Atomizers".

Outside of our industry jargon, "Atomizer" already exists as a word.

> **Atomizer** <sub><sup>(*NOUN*)</sup></sub>
> 1. A device for emitting water, perfume, or other liquids as a fine spray.
> 
> \- [Oxford English Dictionary](https://www.lexico.com/definition/atomizer)

Though actual atomizers themselves have no consistent size, design, color, or shape. So there is no iconic image that represents them.

And though perfume bottles can also come in many shapes, colors, sizes and designs, they are still recognizable as perfume bottles.
